#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS ISSUES BETA WAITING DONE
Development notes:
* Open Questions:
** How to control if a species itself is active?
   Don't want to make it 'implied', meaning that, for example, a user turns off CO by not including any instances.
** How to deal with interconnectivity in mixed species environments? e.g. CH4 on but CO & CO2 off.
* TODO Error control     
* IN-PROGRESS Initialization
** Interface
   Keep everything runtime controlled. As much as possible.
*** Config
**** Read in instances
     Convert to list? As a line of entries, it is compact.
**** Read in passives
     What if name in passive list isn't an instance? Error out. %%%
     
* TODO Run
** Surface
** Chemistry
** Aggregation for *_total()
** What else?
* TODO Finalize
* TODO Features
** coupling to other components
** using integer indexing to connect instances to other elements (e.g. fluxes, diagnostics)
   currently relies on strings. String searches are wet blankets
